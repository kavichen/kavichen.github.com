## 今日问题总汇   
  
### Core Data Thread Safety    
  
#### CoreData  
1. entity 和 managed object 的区别

     - Entity refers to description of an object.

     - Managed object refers to actual concrete instances of that entity created at runtime.

     - The distinction between entities and managed objects is similar to the distinction between a class and instances of that class.



2. You generally won't work with your persistent store directly, but rather will use something called a  managed object context, often referred to as just a context. The context manages access to the persistent store and maintains information about which properties have changed since the last time an object was saved. The context also undo a single change or roll back all the way to the last time data was saved.
