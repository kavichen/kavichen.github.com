## Extending an existing Cocoa class  
  
This lets you add your own methods to an existing class. For example, if you want to extend NSString to apply special capitalization, you could create a new class called, say NSString+Capitals. in the NSString+Capitals.h you would have:  
  
	@interface NSString (Capitals)
	
	-(NSString *)alternateCaps:(NSString *)aString;
	
	@end  

and in NSString+Capitals.m you would implement the method
	
	@implementation NSString (Capitals)
	-(NSString *)alternateCaps:(NSString *)aString
	{
	    // Implementation
	}
