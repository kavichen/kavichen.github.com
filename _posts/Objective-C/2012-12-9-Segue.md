## 当Destination Controller中的ViewDidLoad已经被执行，但Source Controller中prepareForSegue还没有把参数传递过来。

What I have discovered so far, is that with any segue identifier that is not popover these are the invocations made by iOS:

prepareForSegue (on source controller)
viewDidLoad (on destination controller)
while in popover segue the invocation order is:

viewDidLoad (on destination controller)
prepareForSegue (on source controller)
just because I put all my logic in viewDidLoad, the controller was not properly initialized, and a crash happened. So this is not exactly true that prepareForSegue is not called, the truth is that I was getting an exception, and I wrongly mistaken as prepareForSegue not getting called.

I couldn't put everything in viewWillAppear because a call to CoreData had to be made and I didn't want to check if entities were ok each time the view display.

How did I solve this ? I created another method in destination controller

	-(void)prepareViewController {
	  // initialization logic...
	}  

and changing the prepareForSegue method in source controller itself:

	-(void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {
	  MyViewController *mvc = (MyViewController*)[segue destinationViewController];
	  // passing variable 
	  // with segue style other than popover this called first than viewDidLoad
	  mvc.myProp1=@"prop1"; 
	  mvc.myProp2=@"prop2";
	
	  // viewWillAppear is not yet called
	  // so by sending message to controller
	  // the view is initialized
	  [mvc prepareViewController];
	
	}  

don't know if this is expected behavior with popover, anyway now things are working.
