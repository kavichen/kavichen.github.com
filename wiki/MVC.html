<h1 id="toc_1">简介</h1>
<p>
Divide objects in your program into 3 "camps".
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Model

<li>
Controller

<li>
View

</ol>
<h2 id="toc_1.1">Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Model = What your application is  (but not how it is displayed)

<li>
The Model and View should never speak to each other.

<ul>
<li>
Model is completely UI independent.

</ul>
<li>
The data source in the delegate always is the controller, or the third class designated by controller, but they will never be the model.

<li>
So what if the Model has information to update or something?

<ul>
<li>
Ans: It uses a "radio station"-like broadcast mechanism. Controllers (or other Model) "tune in" to interesting stuff. A View might "tune in", but probably not to a Model's "station".

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1.2">Controller</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Controller = How your Model is presented to the user (UI logic)

<li>
Controllers can always talk directly to  their Model.

<li>
Controllers can also talk directly to their View. (With outlets)

<li>
The Controller sets itself as the View's delegate

<ul>
<li>
will

<li>
did

<li>
should

</ul>
<li>
Controllers are almost always that data source (not Model!).

<li>
The data source in the delegate always is the controller, or the third class designated by controller, but they will never be the model.

<li>
Controllers interpret/format Model information for the View.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1.3">View</h2>
<ul>
<li>
View = Your Controller's minions

<li>
Be as generic as possible

<li>
The Model and View should never speak to each other.

<li>
View could talk to controller with Target - Action.

<li>
Sometimes the view needs to synchronize with the Controller.

<li>
<strong>Views do not own the data they display</strong>

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1.4">MVCs working together</h2>
<p>
Q:Every model and every model has one controller.
A:Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q:Can controller talk each other's views?
A:Usually a controller would only have a point to another controller as it's view, it will ask that controller display something for it.
