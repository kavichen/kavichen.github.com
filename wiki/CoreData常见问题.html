<h2 id="toc_1.1">entity和managed object的区别</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Entity refers to description of an object.

<li>
Managed object refers to actual concrete instances of that entity created at runtime.

<li>
The distinction between entities and managed objects is similar to the distinction between a class and instances of that class.

</ul>
 
<p>
You generally won’t work with your persistent store directly, but rather will use something called a managed object context, often referred to as just a context. The context manages access to the persistent store and maintains information about which properties have changed since the last time an object was saved. The context also undo a single change or roll back all the way to the last time data was saved.
