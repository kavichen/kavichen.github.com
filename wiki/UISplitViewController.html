<h2 id="toc_1.1">Setting/Getting the view controllers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Both view controllers are almost always set with ctrl-drag in Xcode.

<li>
<code>@property (nonatomic, copy) NSArray *viewControllers; // 0 is left (master), 1 is right (detail)</code>

<li>
It doesn't really make sense for this array to have anything but 2 UIViewControllers in it.

<li>
Note that this is not a readonly @property.

<li>
But also note that it forces you to set/get the both at the same time.

<li>
It is <code>copy</code> so that you don't pass a mutable array and then try to modify it afterwards.

</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="toc_1.2">So how does the detail get updated when master changes?</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Target

<li>
Action

</ol>
<h3 id="toc_1.2.1">Target/Action</h3>
<p>
Example (code in the master view controller):
</p>
<pre>
  - (IBAction)doit
    {
      id detailViewContoller = [[self.splitViewController viewControllers] lastObject];
      [detailViewController setSomeProperty:...];
    }
</pre>
<h3 id="toc_1.2.2">Segue for split view entirely replaces the detail view controlelr</h3>
<p>
Complicated !
