<h1 id="toc_1">Target action vs Delegation</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Delegate are usually implemented using Protocols instead of selectors. This is a more formal way of communicating across classes, and is mostly useful when there is more than one method that may be needed.

<li>
Target/Action are generally used to correspond to an "event-like" situation, suck as a click, a timer firing, etc.

</ul>
